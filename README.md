Mission Statement: Colors are hard if you do not know what you are doing. They are especially hard when you have a limited color palette to work with. Minecraft, a game all about creativity and working with the blocks that are given to you, has this problem. It can be very hard to find just the right block or set of blocks to fit your vision of what you want to make. It can be hard to tell what blocks fit best with others. We are going to make a website that, when given a color, can find you the closest equivelant in Minecraft block(s). It will be able to generate block palettes to give you ideas, along with other useful building tools. There isn't a website that exists that features all of these useful things in one place. It will be the go-to site for anybody stuck parsing through the block list in Minecraft.
